Successfully synchronized all localization files across 5 languages (English, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam) with the updated English localization file.

## Key Statistics

- **Generated localization methods**: 183 getters per language
- **Missing keys found**: 0 (all files synchronized)
- **Duplicate keys found**: 0 (only expected ARB format duplicates)

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Missing Keys
All previously missing keys have been verified to be present in all language files:

- `uploadImageFirst` - Upload image first message
- `tapAnalyzeToStart` - Tap analyze to start message
- `selectImageFromCameraOrGallery` - Image selection instruction
- `failedToAnalyzeImage` - Analysis failure message

### 2. Duplicate Keys
No duplicate keys were found. All files contain unique keys with proper ARB format structure.
